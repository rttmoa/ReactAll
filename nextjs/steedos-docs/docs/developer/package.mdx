Steedos is based on the standard npm specification to define packages.

The directory structure of the package files is:

```bash
package1
│   ├── main/default
│   ├── package.json
│   └── package.service.js
```

Each package should contain at least the following contents:

* `package.json`：According to the standard npmjs specification, this file defines the package information, including the package name, version, and dependencies. For more information, please refer to <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json>
* `package.service.js`：his is the microservice for the package, which is a microservice definition file that follows the Moleculer specification. You can write code to control the operations executed when the package is loaded, started, or stopped. For more information, please refer to: <https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/services.html>
* `main/default`folder：This folder stores metadata synchronized from the server, such as objects, fields, list views, permissions, etc.
