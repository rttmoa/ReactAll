## Micro Page Engine

Steedos micro page engine supports different types of page designs within the system, including:

- Application Pages: brand new pages that can be used to design enterprise business data dashboards, cockpit data pages, and more;
- Record Pages: detail pages for data records;

In addition to designing pages, it also supports designing business operation buttons through the designer to achieve complex business interface interaction operations.

The integrated designer in Steedos includes various types of components for users to choose from:

- Native components: Steedos adapts to the native Baidu AMIS standard components, allowing users to design using them;
- Cube components: These are components standardized for Steedos system pages, such as list views, object tables, related tables, and other components. Compared to native components, cube components can be used with simple configurations;
- Custom components: Steedos platform supports user-customized components. After successful publication, the designer can use these custom components.
