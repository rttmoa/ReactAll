# Extend the Reach of Your Organization

Sometimes your users need to work with data and services that are outside your Steedos org. Thereâ€™s a variety of ways you can provide seamless access across org boundaries.

## Provide Buttons

Buttons let users interact with Steedos data and with external websites and services, such as search engines and online maps. Steedos includes several standard buttons . You can also create custom ones.

## External Services

Connect your Steedos org to an external API using Steedos Micro App Builder. Use declarative tools and OpenAPI specifications to describe the external API functionality.

## Work with External Data Sources

An external data source specifies how to access an external system. Steedos Connect uses external data sources to access data that's stored outside your Steedos organization. External data sources have associated external objects, which your users and the platform use to interact with the external data and content.
