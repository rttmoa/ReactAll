      Do you want to execute the actions only when specified changes are made to
      the record?
    help: >-
      When you select yes, the actions are executed only if the record meets the
      criteria now but the values that the record had immediately before it was
      saved didn't meet criteria. This means that these actions won't be
      executed when irrelevant changes are made.
